# Sealights container images

Dockerfiles in these subdirectories are used for building container images for various programming languages with respective Sealights agents installed.

The images are then used for running Sealights instrumentation Tasks, that are currently stored in [build-definitions repository](https://github.com/konflux-ci/build-definitions/tree/main/task).
